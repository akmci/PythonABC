# 1. Python Keywords:

Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

We cannot use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier. 

They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

In Python, keywords are case sensitive.

There are 33 keywords in Python 3.3. 

All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as it is. 

The list of all the keywords are given below.


Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.
